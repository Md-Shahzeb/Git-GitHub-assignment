Qno1. Explain what version control is and its importance in software development?
Ans : Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. 
      In software development, version control systems (VCS) like Git, Subversion (SVN), or Mercurial are crucial for managing 
      codebase changes efficiently.In essence, version control systems are foundational tools in modern software development,
      enabling teams to collaborate effectively, track changes, manage code quality, and streamline development workflows from 
      coding to deployment.Here's why version control is important:
	* Tracking changes.
	* Collaboration.
	* Backup and restore.
	* Branching and Merging.
	* Code Review.
	* Auditing and Compliance.
