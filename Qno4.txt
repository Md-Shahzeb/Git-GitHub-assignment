Ans :  GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for version control using Git. It offers all the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git along with additional features to facilitate collaboration among developers.
       GitHub is widely used for software development and version control, allowing developers to work together on projects from anywhere in the world.
	How GitHub Facilitates Collaboration and Version Control
        Centralized Repository:- GitHub provides a centralized place to store repositories, making it easy for team members to access the latest code and changes.

	Version Control:- GitHub uses Git for version control, enabling tracking of changes, branching, merging, and reverting to previous versions of the codebase.

	Pull Requests:- Pull requests are a core feature of GitHub that allow developers to notify team members about changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository. They provide a platform for code review, discussion, and automated testing before changes are merged into the main codebase.

	Collaboration:- GitHub supports multiple contributors working on the same project. Features like issues, pull requests, project boards, and wikis help manage and document the project collaboratively.

	Code Review:- Team members can review each other's code changes through pull requests, providing comments and suggestions, which helps improve code quality and knowledge sharing.

	Issue Tracking:- GitHub includes an issue tracker to report and track bugs, enhancements, and other tasks. Issues can be linked to pull requests and commits, providing a clear workflow from problem identification to resolution.

	Integration with CI/CD:- GitHub integrates with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring that code changes are validated and deployed efficiently.

	Documentation:- Repositories can include README files, wikis, and GitHub Pages for project documentation, making it easy for new contributors to understand the project.

	Social Coding:- GitHub's platform fosters a community of developers. Users can follow others, star repositories, and fork projects, promoting knowledge sharing and open-source contributions.
