Qno3. Explain what .gitignore is and why itâ€™s important in version control ?
Ans : The .gitignore file is a crucial component in a Git repository that specifies which files and directories Git should 
      ignore. This means that the files and directories listed in .gitignore will not be tracked, staged, or committed to the repository.
      The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a project.The .gitignore file contains 
      patterns that match files and directories. These patterns can use wildcards and other special characters to specify groups of files.
      it's important in version control are:-
       1. Excluding Unnecessary Files: It helps keep the repository clean by excluding files that are not necessary for the project's version history.
       2. Sensitive Information: It prevents sensitive information from being accidentally committed to the repository. This includes: configuration files and API keys and secrets.
       3. Reducing Repository Size: By ignoring unnecessary files, the .gitignore file helps reduce the size of the repository, making it faster to clone and more efficient to work with.
       4. Consistency Across Development Environments: It ensures that all developers working on the project ignore the same set of files, leading to a consistent development environment 
	  and reducing the chance of conflicts or issues related to untracked files.
